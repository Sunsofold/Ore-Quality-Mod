A Zone is a type that takes a map (named the same as the json's filename) and puts it into campaign. (a zone isn't a map)

Every Zone has a Generator, which once initialized, MapGenerator will run through the map and do initialization related stuff. One of those notable things, is deleting all cores on in your map and placing a loadout on top of a random one of them. This allows your campaign map to have multiple core locations. (it doesn't matter which core was previously on the map, loadout will dictate that)

It is entirely possible to produce a custom schematic, but take note that this schematic must contain a CoreBlock within it.
