Custom sounds can be added through the modding system by dropping them in the sounds/ subdirectory. It doesn't matter where you put them. Two formats are needed:

    .ogg required for Desktop/Android
    .mp3 required for iOS

Just like any other assets, you reference them by the stem of your filenames, so pewpew.ogg and pewpew.mp3 can be referenced with pewpew from a field of type Sound.

Here's a list of built-in sounds:
