To override ingame content sprites, you can simply put them in sprites-override/.

All you need to make sprites, is an image editor that supports transparency (aka: not paint). Block sprites should be 32 * size, so a 2x2 block would require a 64x64 image. Images must be .png files with 32 bit depth.

Sprites can simply be dropped in the sprites/ subdirectory. The content parser will look through it recursively, so you can organize them how ever you feel.

Content is going to look for sprites relative to it's own name. content/blocks/my-hail.json has the name my-hail and similarly sprites/my-hail.png has the name my-hail, so it'll be used by this content.

Content may look for multiple sprites. my-hail could be a turret, and it could look for the suffix <name>-heat and what this means is it'll look for my-hail-heat.

You can find all the vanilla sprites here:

Another thing to know about sprites is that some of them are modified by the game. Turrets specifically have a black border added to them, so you must account for that while making your sprites, leaving transparent space around turrets for example: Ripple
